ðŸ§  See the corresponding article for more details about using [Kubernetes w/ Ansible](https://www.erichreich.com/using-kubernetes-without-ansible-is-just-wrong/)

## Pre-Requisites

- Change `pv.yaml` to point to a usable storage in your cluster.

- Change the host in `ingress.yaml` to your liking.

- It is setup to create basic auth for you with username `foo` and password `password`

To change the username and password follow [these instructions](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/auth/basic/) or if you don't want basic auth, just comment it out in `ansible/install.yaml`
